# Shopify App Template - Cloudflare Workers

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/gruntlord5/cloudflare-react-router7-shopify-d1)

## What is this?

A Shopify app starter, built on top of Cloudflare Workers. This template provides a foundation for building a [Shopify app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started) using the [React Router 7](https://reactrouter.com/) framework, deployed on Cloudflare's global network.

## Why would I use this?

This lets you deploy an entire Shopify React Router 7 starter application to Cloudflare with a single click. It will setup a repo and a Cloudflare worker named after your project, along with a D1 database and binding to store the session data.

Cloudflare Workers is flexible, scalable, and even has a [free tier for those just getting started.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/)


| | Requests| Duration | CPU time |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Free** | 100,000 per day | No charge for duration | 10 milliseconds of CPU time per invocation |
| **Standard** | 10 million included per month +$0.30 per additional million | No charge or limit for duration | 30 million CPU milliseconds included per month +$0.02 per additional million CPU milliseconds Max of [5 minutes of CPU time](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#worker-limits) per invocation (default: 30 seconds) Max of 15 minutes of CPU time per [Cron Trigger](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/) or [Queue Consumer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/javascript-apis/#consumer) invocation |

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need the following:

1. **Cloudflare Account**: [Sign up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) if you don't have one.
2. **Shopify Partner Account**: [Create an account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) if you don't have one.
3. **Shopify App**: Create an app in the [Shopify partner dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/organizations).
4. **Test Store**: Set up either a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) or a [Shopify Plus sandbox store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/plus-sandbox-store) for testing your app.

## Quick Start

1. Click the "Deploy to Cloudflare" button at the top of this README.
2. Configure your deployment settings including worker name and repository details.
3. After deployment, update the `wrangler.jsonc` file in your new repository with the credentials from your Shopify app:

```jsonc
"vars": {
 "SHOPIFY_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here", // Don't use this in production, use secrets in the dashboard https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/#adding-secrets-to-your-project
 "SHOPIFY_API_SECRET": "your_api_secret_here", // Don't use this in production, use secrets in the dashboard https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/#adding-secrets-to-your-project
 "SHOPIFY_APP_URL": "https://your-worker-name.workers.dev",
 "SCOPES": "write_products,read_orders", // adjust scopes as needed
}
````
You should consider storing them [as secrets in a production application.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/#adding-secrets-to-your-project) 
## Enabling Additional Databases
This template supports multiple D1 databases which can be useful for more complex applications. Two additional databases (DB2 and DB3) are included in the configuration but commented out by default. Here's how to enable them:
1. Create the databases in Cloudflare Dashboard:
- Go to your Cloudflare Dashboard
- Navigate to Storage & Databases > D1 SQL Database
- Click "Create"
- Name your databases shop_auth_exampledb2 and shop_auth_exampledb3 (these names should match the database name in your wrangler.jsonc)
- Note the generated database IDs for each
2. Update your wrangler.jsonc file
```jsonc
{
  // ... other configuration
  "d1_databases": [
    {
      "binding": "DB",
      "database_name": "shop_auth",
      "database_id": "151f7d9b-365f-41d7-83ed-0bf4eeef5086"
    },
    {
      "binding": "DB2",
      "database_name": "shop_auth_exampledb2",
      "database_id": "your-actual-db2-id-from-dashboard"
    },
    {
      "binding": "DB3",
      "database_name": "shop_auth_exampledb3",
      "database_id": "your-actual-db3-id-from-dashboard"
    }
  ],
  // ... rest of configuration
  ````

3. Commit and deploy your changes:
  - After deployment, your Worker will have access to all three databases. You can access them in your code using the bindings. 
  - Visit the example page in the app to see how to interact with multiple databases.

## Authenticating and querying data

To authenticate and query data you can use the `shopify` const that is exported from `/app/shopify.server.ts`:

```js
export async function loader({ request }) {
  const { admin } = await shopify.authenticate.admin(request);

  const response = await admin.graphql(`
    {
      products(first: 25) {
        nodes {
          title
          description
        }
      }
    }`);

  const {
    data: {
      products: { nodes },
    },
  } = await response.json();

  return nodes;
}
````

This template comes preconfigured with examples of:

1. Setting up your Shopify app in [/app/shopify.server.ts](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/shopify.server.ts)
2. Querying data using Graphql. Please see: [/app/routes/app.\_index.tsx](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/routes/app._index.tsx).
3. Responding to mandatory webhooks in [/app/routes/webhooks.tsx](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/routes/webhooks.tsx)

Please read the [documentation for @shopify/shopify-app-remix](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/shopify-app-remix#authenticating-admin-requests) to understand what other API's are available.

## Troubleshooting

### Updating the URL for your App

You may get an error similar to this "Error: Invalid appUrl configuration 'example.workers.dev', please provide a valid URL." When trying to update the domain in wrangler.jsonc

Make sure you have the url formatted properly, in this example it would be "https://example.workers.dev/"

### Navigating/redirecting breaks an embedded app

Embedded Shopify apps must maintain the user session, which can be tricky inside an iFrame. To avoid issues:

1. Use `Link` from `react-router` or `@shopify/polaris`. Do not use `<a>`.
2. Use the `redirect` helper returned from `authenticate.admin`. Do not use `redirect` from `react-router`
3. Use `useSubmit` or `<Form/>` from `react-router`. Do not use a lowercase `<form/>`.

This only applies if your app is embedded, which it will be by default.

### Non Embedded

Shopify apps are best when they are embedded in the Shopify Admin, which is how this template is configured. If you have a reason to not embed your app please make the following changes:

1. Ensure `embedded = false` is set in [shopify.app.toml`](./shopify.app.toml). [Docs here](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-configuration#global).
2. Pass `isEmbeddedApp: false` to `shopifyApp()` in `./app/shopify.server.js|ts`.
3. Change the `isEmbeddedApp` prop to `isEmbeddedApp={false}` for the `AppProvider` in `/app/routes/app.jsx|tsx`.
4. Remove the `@shopify/app-bridge-react` dependency from [package.json](./package.json) and `vite.config.ts|js`.
5. Remove anything imported from `@shopify/app-bridge-react`.  For example: `NavMenu`, `TitleBar` and `useAppBridge`.

### OAuth goes into a loop when I change my app's scopes

If you change your app's scopes and authentication goes into a loop and fails with a message from Shopify that it tried too many times, you might have forgotten to update your scopes with Shopify.
To do that, you can run the `deploy` CLI command.

### My shop-specific webhook subscriptions aren't updated

If you are registering webhooks in the `afterAuth` hook, using `shopify.registerWebhooks`, you may find that your subscriptions aren't being updated.  

Instead of using the `afterAuth` hook, the recommended approach is to declare app-specific webhooks in the `shopify.app.toml` file.  This approach is easier since Shopify will automatically update changes to webhook subscriptions every time you run `deploy`.  Please read these guides to understand more:

1. [app-specific vs shop-specific webhooks](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe#app-specific-subscriptions)
2. [Create a subscription tutorial](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe/get-started?framework=remix&deliveryMethod=https)
